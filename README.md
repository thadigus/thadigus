## Philosophy

> “IT operations is a game of problem solving. By constantly taking on new challenges, we find better solutions for the issues we interact with every day.”

My work is driven by curiosity, practical thinking, and a continuous improvement mindset. I aim to design systems that are secure, stable, and well-documented.
